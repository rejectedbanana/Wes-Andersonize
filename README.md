Wes-Andersonize
===============

Inspired by the Wes Anderson color palette, make Matlab plots in the Wes Anderson style https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson

Make your matlab plots look they came directly from The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. 

matlab colormap “zissou.m” 
matlab function “zissoumyplot.m”  

The Futura Font must be installed on your computer for zissoumyplot to work properly.

Inspired by and translated from the Wes Anderson Palettes R package (https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson)
