# Wes-Andersonize

Make your matlab plots look they came directly from The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Inspired by and translated from the Wes Anderson Palettes R package (https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson)

### zissoumyplot.m function
Changes all fonts in current figure to Futura and changes the colormap to zissou.m. The Futura Font must be installed on your computer for zissoumyplot to work properly.
